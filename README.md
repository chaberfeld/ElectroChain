# ElectroChain


Final project for CSC-587 "Computer Simulation and Modeling", Fall 2015.<br />
<br />
At program setup, ten "balls" are represented on a plane with fixed distances between them.<br />
Then their positions are randomly reset, keeping the original distances, starting with ball 2 through to 10.<br />
Besides starting position, some balls are assigned something akin to "hydrophobicity"; this drives the action, <br />
as these balls will attempt to get as close to one another as possible. Yes--this was inspired by protein folding<br />
simulations; it is a very primitive version, but is still interesting to watch.<br />
The question I wanted to answer was: given a random starting configuration, would the system find the low energy state<br />
every time, as in nature?   Run it to find out...<br />
